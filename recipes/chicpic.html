    <h5>These quick and easy pan-fried chicken breasts are topped 
        with a simple pan sauce made with capers, butter, white wine,
        and lemon juice.</h5>
    <p>Chicken Piccata is one of my all time favorite dishes. 
       Tender chicken breasts are dredged in a lemon pepper flour 
       and seared until golden. The chicken is then simmered in a 
       fresh lemon caper white wine sauce. Serve this easy (yet 
       seemingly fancy) dish over pasta or mashed potatoes to 
       impress your family and friends</p>
    <p>Chicken Piccata (or any piccata such as veal piccata) is a 
       dish that features meat pounded thin and topped with a buttery
       lemon caper sauce.This lemon chicken piccata is usually served 
       over pasta and I prefer a thinner pasta such as angel hair or a light 
       linguine as its a delicate dish. It also goes great with Oven Roasted 
       Potatoes  and a side of baked zucchini or steamed broccoli!</p>
    <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
        <p>The following is what we will need to make this dish:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves </li>
            <li>cayenne pepper, or to taste </li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>
            <li>all-purpose flour for dredging </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon capers, drained</li>
            <li>½ cup white wine </li>
            <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice </li>
            <li>¼ cup water </li>
            <li>3 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut in 1/4-inch slices </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh Italian parsley, chopped </li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chicken breasts between 2 layers of plastic wrap and 
                pound to about 1/2-inch thick.</li>
            <li>Season both sides of chicken breasts with cayenne, salt, 
                and black pepper; dredge lightly in flour and shake off any excess.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken 
                in the pan, reduce heat to medium, and cook until browned and cooked 
                through, about 5 minutes per side; remove to a plate.</li>
            <li>Cook capers in reserved oil, smashing them lightly to release brine, 
                until warmed though, about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Pour white wine into skillet. Scrape any browned bits from the bottom 
                of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until reduced by half, 
                about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir lemon juice, water, and butter into the reduced wine mixture; 
                cook and stir continuously to form a thick sauce, about 2 minutes. 
                Reduce heat to low and stir parsley through the sauce.</li>
            <li>Return chicken breasts to the pan cook until heated through, 1 
                to 2 minutes. Serve with sauce spooned over the top.</li>
        </ol>
