    <h5>This is a delicious apple cobbler. My son often requests it 
        instead of cake as a birthday dessert! </h5>
    <p>Many apple cobbler recipes are made with a biscuit like topping, 
        I wanted the same old-fashioned cake-like topping that I use in 
        my other recipes! It has a slight crisp on the top and is soft 
        in the center, and pairs so well with the sauce and tender 
        apples in this recipe.</p>
    <p>There is a difference between apple crisp and apple cobbler. 
        Just like its name, apple crisp has a crispy crumble topping 
        made with oats. The topping for this apple cobbler is a 
        smooth batter that is poured on top of the apple filling 
        and bakes more cake-like.</p>
